Video Walkthrough: https://youtu.be/eHaXw8Bd_ms

    Fork this repo and name it <your-username>
    In your forked repo, go to the Settings tab > actions > general. In the Workflow permissions section, toggle Read and Write permissions and press save. This will allow for the snake contributions svg to be generated based on your own contributions via Github Actions.
    Go to the Actions tab, select Generate Snake and click run workflow. That way, you will manually generate your first snake svg; after that, a new one will be generated every 12 hours.
    On line 1, rename page_id url param to <your-username>.<your-username>
    On line 4, rename lines url param to whatever you`d like
    Customize lines 11-21 to fit your description
    Customize your Socials section (23-33)
    Customize your Tools section (37-42)
    On line 50, change /Elghrabawy/Elghrabawy/ to /<your-username>/<your-username>/. This will make sure that you're fetching your snake contributions svg and not mine.
    In your stats section, rename https://github-readme-Elghrabawy.vercel.app to https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app. The first one is my private instance of the repo, and I use it so my private contributions are taken into account as well. Hosting your private instance of github-readme-stats on Vercel is quite a simple process and recommended; if you're interested, click here.
    In the same section, replace github-readme-streak-stats-Elghrabawy.vercel.app with https://streak-stats.demolab.com. If you want to host your own instance, which I highly recommend as it is down often, follow the instructions here.
    Customize your support link or replace it with footer typing animation (line 73).
    You're good to go! Make sure to leave a ‚≠ê if you like this repo!
